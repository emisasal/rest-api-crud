# REST API Crud

#### Basic Backend using Express, Prisma ORM, TpeScript and Postgres database

---

## Start the project

- After clonning this repository run from root `npm i`.
- Create a postgres db named `rest-api-crud`.
- Push the schema and seeds with `npm run seed`.
- Start the local server with `npm run dev`.

## Project creation

- Install Node (if you have't already). For this project I'm currently using v20.12.1 LST.
- Create an empty postgres database. The db I'm using is called `rest-api-crud`.
- Create the folder and initialize npm with `npm init -y`.
- Add git remote to the GithHub repository for the project.
- Install `express` dependency (node framework).
- Install the devDependencies: `prisma`, `typescript`, `nodemon`, `ts-node`, `@types/node` and `@types/express`.
  - Prisma: the ORM (Objectâ€“relational mapping).
  - Nodemon: to monitor for changes in the server and restart automatically.
  - TS-Node: TypeScript execution engine and REPL for Node.js.
  - @Types/Node and @Types-Express: TypeScript types definitions.
- Create `tsconfig.json` file with default configurations:
  ```
  {
  "compilerOptions": {
    "sourceMap": true,
    "outDir": "dist",
    "strict": true,
    "lib": ["esnext"],
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    }
  }
  ```
- Add scripts for:
  - Development: `"dev": "nodemon src/index.ts"`.
  - Production: `"build": "npx tsc"`. This script creates a transpiled JavaScript build in the folder `/dist`.
  - To execute production build: `"start": "node dist/index.ts"`.
- Initialize Prisma using `npx prisma init --datasource-provider postgresql`. This creates `/prisma` folder with the schema configured for Postgres and `.env` file for enviroment variables.
- Add postgres user, password and database name in `DATABASE_URL` inside `.env` file.

## Enviroment Variables

I'm using `dotenvx` dependecy to handle the enviroment variables for development `.env.development` and production `.env.production`.
In order to combine variables using dotenvx I changed the dev script to: `dotenvx run --env-file=.env.development --env-file=.env -- nodemon api/app.ts`.
And the production script to: `dotenvx run --env-file=.env.development --env-file=.env -- npx tsc`.

## Database Schema

This is the original ERD schema for an online bookstore database.

I created a new ERD using `draw.io` with some changes in relations and data types taking advantage of some unique postgres features and good practices.

For example, all the string values are `TEXT` fiels (postgres recommends against char or varchar with param because it uses more db space), for money values I'm using the `MONEY` field and for dates `TMESTAMPTZ`.

## Database creation

Following prisma's documentation I created an empty postgres db with the name `rest_api_crud`. I'm using **Postgress.app** to create and execute postgres db's and **Postico** for tables visualization and editing.

For migration I used `npx prisma migrate dev --name init`.
This migrates the models to the db and creates a folder in `/prisma/migrations` with a migration file with the given name (in this case "init").
If not previously installed, the script will install `prisma-client-js` generator to connect to the db.

> The script for production and testing migrations is `npx prisma migrate deploy`. But is only recommended for automated CI/CD pipelines.

## Seeds

I used Mockaroo (https://www.mockaroo.com/) to create fake data .
The files are located in `/prisma/seedData` named `.seed.ts`.
I'm using objects (not `json`) to avoid the conversion process.
Because the dates have an incorrect format I'm mapping the arrays to replace them to ISO format.

To aviod conflicts with the relations between models I created a function that execute `Promise.all` applying "upsert" for every object.
This solves the issue of duplicate data and allows the seeds to be applied multiple times.

> The `Promise.all` for seeding the models in the `runSeeders()` function must respect this order:
>
> 1. Models without relations declaration.
> 2. Models with relations to previous models.
>
> This happens because the seeds store false ids. If the second model tries to make a relation to a non-existent id it will return an error.

To run the seeds in the db use the script `npm run seed`. It executes "prima db push" (forces db schema) combined with `prisma/seed.ts`.

## Routes

The routes for the models are located in `/api/routes`. I used an `index.ts` file to simplify the import of the routes in the server.

## Cors

The dependency `cors` (along with `@types/cors` as devDependency) enables cors to comunicate with a frontend running with a different port.

## Logger

The projet uses `morgan` http logger in "dev" (reduced details) mode for development and "common" for production (shows mor details).

## ToDo

- Routes
- Controllers
- config cors
- morgan
- Seed from json and cvs
- Testing
- Swagger
- Export db to `.CSV`
- docker
